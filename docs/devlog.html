            <h3>How does our engine work?</h3>
            <p>RayCasting, is a technique that creates a "3D-like view" from a "2D map". Rays are cast from the player`s position in the viewing direction, and each ray stops when it hits a wall in the 2D grid. The distance to the wall is then used to calculate the height of a vertical slice on the screen. By drawing these slices side by side, a scene appears three-dimensional without using a true 3D world.</p>

            <h3>Hardest Part</h3>
            <p>One of the hardest part of writing DDA Algorithm, was when I wanted to run it with pixel cordination, but it should be written with map cordination. But first I didnt know it so I wrote it with pixel cordination and it wasted so much of my time before I found out it was wrong. </p>
